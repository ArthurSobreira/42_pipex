“For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed 
that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had 
achieved so much—the wheel, New York, wars and so on—whilst 
all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water 
having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always 
believed that they were far more intelligent than man—for 
precisely the same reasons.”

“This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: 
most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much 
of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, 
but most of these were largely concerned with the movement of 
small green pieces of paper, which was odd because on the whole 
it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.”
